HEROKKU DEPLOYMENT:
    deployed previous session in the herokku => https://session-44.herokuapp.com

TO SEE BOTH THE LOCAL AND THE HEROKKU SERVER DATA EASILY WHILE QUERYING IN POST MAN:
    this can be done by creating a environment in postman
    =>select environment in the side bar
    =>select create environment
    =>give a name to the environment
    =>create a variable called "host"
    =>give initial and current value as the link of the localhost that we use to
            run the node js server locally
    => like this same method create another variable for the Production where the 
            link will be of deployed server in the herokku      

    TO VIEW THE DATA INSIDE THE SERVER:
        type "{{variable name assigned "host"}}"(followed by the created routes) in the link bar of post man
        now we can see data of both the local and online simultaneously by toggling between
            the environment created in the top right corner of the screen

    !dont add "/" at the end of link while creating a environment

CONNECTING THE REACT APP TO THE HEROKKU LINK:

TO FIND THE REACT APP FOR THIS SESSION 
    go to REACT SESSION => NODE JS => SESSION 44
    !CHECK THE MoviesList.js file         

CORS ERROR:
    node js doesnt allow different origin. the origin and the reequest url have to be same for the node to allow to use his server
    in our case the origin is localhost:3000 and the request url is herokku link
    so we get an error saying cors error

    To avoid it we need to inform node that it is safe to allow the origin
    this method is made to safe the api from being availble for everyone
    so that if anyone want to use our api they have to ask our permission and we can also get paid for that
    without our knowledge no one can access our api

    METHOD TO INFORM THE NODE:1
        for that we need a package called cors
        install by typing => npm i cors
